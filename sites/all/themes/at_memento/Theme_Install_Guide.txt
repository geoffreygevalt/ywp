## About Demos vs Themes in Drupal

Drupal sites require configuration, do not expect what you see in the online
demo, which is a fully configured Drupal site with this theme applied to it.
If that's what you need, install the demo site. The demo site can also act
as the perfect guide to setting up your own site and theme.
